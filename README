1. Introduction

This extension is designed to provide access to the Ingres Enterprise
Relational Database Management System. Native or direct access is provided for
Ingres II 2.0, Ingres II 2.5, Advantage Ingres 2.6 and Ingres r3. To access
older versions, a supported client environment can be used with Ingres/NET.
In 2005, the Ingres extension was moved to the PHP extension community library
(PECL) to resolve a build conflict with Windows and UNIX/Linux platforms. One
advantage of this move is it allows the extension to be developed with its own
release cycle. This permits new functionality to be released when possible
instead of waiting for the next official PHP release. Rather than being
available via the main PHP tarball/zip archive (http://www.php.net/downloads),
an additional download is required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Platform support


Ingres Releases

This extension has been written to support the following versions of Ingres:

* Ingres II 2.0/OpenIngres 2.0
* Ingres II 2.5
* Advantage Ingres 2.6
* Ingres r3


PHP Releases

This extension has been written against PHP 5.1. Prior versions of PHP, i.e.
4.0.x - 5.0.x, contain an earlier version of the Ingres extension. Building the
extension with earlier versions requires the deletion of the ingres_ii
directory under ext.

Operating System Compatibility

The extension should work against any platform where the above Ingres releases
are supported. In practice the extension has been developed on Windows XP using
Visual Studio .Net 2003 (VC7) and SuSE 9.3/Fedora Core 3 using GCC 3.3.x. There
has been limited testing on Solaris 9 Sparc. If you find the extension does not
work, please contact grantc@php.net with the following information:

* operating system and patches/service pack installed
* compiler + version used to build the extension
* version of PHP being used
* version of Ingres being used
* if you managed to get the extension built, the value of the constants
  INGRES_EXT_VERSION and INGRES_API_VERSION:

    <?php
    	echo INGRES_EXT_VERSION + " " + INGRES_API_VERSION;
    ?>



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Function support

ingres_error           Get the error text
ingres_errno           Get the error code
ingres_errsqlstate     Get the SQLState
ingres_fetch_array     Fetch a row of result into an array
ingres_fetch_object    Fetch a row of result into an object
ingres_fetch_row       Fetch a row of result into an enumerated array
ingres_field_length    Get the length of a field
ingres_field_name      Get the name of a field in a query result
ingres_field_nullable  Test if a field is nullable
ingres_field_precision Get the precision of a field
ingres_field_scale     Get the scale of a field
ingres_field_type      Get the type of a field in a query result
ingres_num_fields      Get the number of fields returned by the last query
ingres_num_rows        Get the number of rows affected or returned by the last
                       query
ingres_pconnect        Open a persistent connection to an Ingres database
ingres_query           Send a SQL query to Ingres

Project home page

The latest tar ball for this extension can be downloaded from http://
pecl.php.net/project/ingres. At the moment only source code is available for
download via this page. Development snapshot builds of the PECL extension for
Windows can be downloaded from http://snaps.php.net. Binary releases for
certain operating systems will be provided in due course.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Installing the extension


Windows Installation

The latest binaries for the Ingres extension can be downloaded from http://
snaps.php.net. Direct links are provided below for different PHP releases:

* http://snaps.php.net/win32/PECL_5_0/php_ingres.dll
* http://snaps.php.net/win32/PECL_5_1/php_ingres.dll
* http://snaps.php.net/win32/PECL_UNSTABLE/php_ingres.dll

To activate the extension copy php_ingres.dll into the extension_dir configured
in php.ini. Then add the following line to php.ini:

  	extension=php_ingres.dll


UNIX/Linux Installation

The installation of the extension on UNIX/Linux will require a C complilation
environment.
The latest source code can be downloaded manually from http://pecl.php.net/get/
ingres. Or by using PEAR:

  	pear download ingres

Once you have the source archive run through the following steps to build and
install, note that $II_SYSTEM needs to be defined beforehand:

  1. Extract the archive, adapt the version number accordingly:

       tar -zxvf ingres-1.0.tgz

  2. Enter the newly created directory:

       cd ingres-1.0

  3. Generate the configuration file for the extension:

       phpize

  4. Generate the Makefile needed to build the extension:

       ./configure

  5. Build the extension:

       make

  6. Install the extension, N.B. this may require root access :

       make install

5. Known issues

There are no known issues at this time.

6. Future direction

Since the code has been relatively stable for a number of years, all current
development efforts have tried to avoid, where possible, changing syntax of any
existing function. The TODO file covers the items that are on the list to be
implemented.
There are, however, some things that would be nice to have but might prove
difficult to implement without breaking backwards compatibility, either with
versions of Ingres or with existing Ingres based PHP code.
The current extension maintains a single statement handle. Whenever a query is
executed via ingres_query() or ingres_prepare(), any existing statement is
terminated/closed. For multiple resultsets to work, the ingres_fetch_*()
statements will need to be able to accept a resource that represents an Ingres
resultset. Such that:

    ingres_fetch_row( [resource link] )

would have to change to:

    ingres_fetch_row( resource result )

Note '[]' means anything contained within is optional. Apart from passing a
result resource instead of a link resource, the main difference is the
parameter passed would be a mandatory parameter rather than optional as it is
at the moment. This is more in keeping with how other PHP database interfaces
work. Link resource parameters that are currently optional would become
mandatory. Implementing this would make the extension incompatible with
existing scripts that use Ingres.
It is possible for the code to be branched such that any future versions that
break backwards compatibility are clearly marked as doing so. This will be done
according to demand.

7. Comments/suggestions/credits

The architecture for the Ingres extension is based on code written by David
Henot (henot@php.net) from 2000-2004.  Since February 2005, Grant Croker,
(grantc@php.net), took over the maintenance and development of the extension.
If you have any comments, features or if you wish to assist in some way with
coding, testing or documentation please contact grantc@php.net.
