Introduction

This extension is designed to provide access to the Ingres Enterprise
Relational Database Management System. Native or direct access is provided for
Ingres II 2.0, Ingres II 2.5, Advantage Ingres 2.6 and Ingres r3. To access
older versions, a supported client environment can be used with Ingres/NET.
In 2005, the Ingres extension was moved to the PHP extension community library
(PECL) to resolve a build conflict with Windows and UNIX/Linux platforms. One
advantage of this move is it allows the extension to be developed with its own
release cycle. This permits new functionality to be released when possible
instead of waiting for the next official PHP release. Rather than being
available via the main PHP tarball/zip archive (http://www.php.net/downloads),
an additional download is required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Platform support



Ingres Releases

This extension has been written to support the following versions of Ingres:

* Ingres II 2.0/OpenIngres 2.0
* Ingres II 2.5
* Advantage Ingres 2.6
* Ingres r3 / 3.0.x
* Ingres 2006 / 9.0.0
* Ingres 2006 Release 2 / 9.1.0
* Ingres 2006 Release 2 Service Pack 1 / 9.1.1
* Ingres 9.2.0
* Ingres 9.3.0



PHP Releases

This extension has been written against PHP 5.1 and PHP 5.2. Prior versions of
PHP, i.e. 4.0.x - 5.0.x, contain an earlier version of the Ingres extension.
Building the extension with earlier versions requires the deletion of the
ingres_ii directory under ext.


Operating System Compatibility

The extension should work against any platform where the above Ingres releases
are supported. In practice the extension has been developed on Windows XP using
Visual Studio .Net 2003 (VC7) and openSuSE 11 using GCC 4.3. There has been
limited testing on Solaris 10 Sparc. If you find the extension does not work,
please log a bug via the project_home_page with the following information:

* operating system and patches/service pack installed
* compiler + version used to build the extension
* version of PHP being used
* version of Ingres being used
* if you managed to get the extension built, the value of the constants
  INGRES_EXT_VERSION and INGRES_API_VERSION:

    <?php
            echo INGRES_EXT_VERSION . " " . INGRES_API_VERSION;
    ?>



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing the extension



Windows Installation

The latest binaries for the Ingres extension can be downloaded from http://
esd.ingres.com/product/drivers/PHP. To install the extension copy
php_ingres.dll into the extension_dir configured in php.ini.

UNIX/Linux Installation

The installation of the extension on UNIX/Linux will require a C complilation
environment. If you have built and installed PHP from source code obtained via
CVS or an archive, you will already have the necessary files. If however you
are using Linux and have installed PHP using the operating system package
manager (Synaptic, Package Kit, yum, aptitude or zypper) then it is probable
you will also need to install the "development" package for PHP. This
additional package contains the necessary files needed for building and
installing PHP extensions, such as ingres. Below is a list of the PHP
development packages for Redhat, SuSE and Ubuntu/Debian:

* SuSE Linux Enterprise Server / openSuSE - php4-devel - for PHP 4.x
* SuSE Linux Enterprise Server / openSuSE - php5-devel - for PHP 5.x
* Redhat Enterprise Linux/Centos/Fedora - php-devel
* Debian/Ubuntu Linux - php-dev

Please refer to the operating system documentation for more information on how
to install the necessary packages.

Installing with pecl

The Ingres extension can be downloaded an installed using just one command:

   pecl install ingres

When prompted:

  1. Enter 'all'
  2. Provide the value for $II_SYSTEM
  3. Press enter
  4. Follow the instructions at the end of the build for activating the
     extension


Installing from source

The latest source code can be downloaded manually from http://pecl.php.net/get/
ingres. Once you have the source archive run through the following steps to
build and install, note that $II_SYSTEM needs to be defined beforehand:

  1. Extract the archive, adapt the version number accordingly:

       tar -zxvf ingres-2.2.2.tgz

  2. Enter the newly created directory:

       cd ingres-2.2.2

  3. Generate the configuration file for the extension:

       phpize

  4. Generate the Makefile needed to build the extension:

       ./configure

  5. Build the extension:

       make

  6. Install the extension, N.B. this may require root access :

       make install

  7. If your PHP build environment is not the same as the target PHP
     environment then use the following command, N.B. this may require root
     access :

       cp -v modules/ingres.so `php -r 'echo ini_get("extension_dir");'`

     Where php is the PHP executable for your target environment.


Ingres with the Apache web server on UNIX/Linux

This extension, like other Ingres applications, requires knowledge of a local
Ingres installation. The Apache extension, mod_env is required for this to
work. The following assumes Ingres was installed to /opt/Ingres/II:

* In the script that starts Apache add the following lines:

    II_SYSTEM=/opt/Ingres/II
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib
    export II_SYSTEM LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* Add the following lines to the apache configuration script httpd.conf (or
  equivalent):

    PassEnv II_SYSTEM LD_LIBRARY_PATH



Activating the Ingres PECL extension


Windows

Add the following line to the php.ini configuration file:

  extension = php_ingres.dll

If a web server is being used to serve PHP scripts, restart it to activate the
Ingres extension.

UNIX/Linux

Add the following line to the php.ini configuration file:

  extension = ingres.so

If a web server is being used to serve PHP scripts, restart it to activate the
Ingres extension.

Known issues


Bugs

For a list of known bugs go to pecl.php.net.

Multi-threaded web servers

When working with multi-threaded web servers certain considerations need to be
made. Each HTTP server thread represents a single DBMS server connection, that
could potentially connect to an Ingres server, either directly or via Ingres/
NET. Depending on the number of server threads configured this could exceed the
number of sessions allowed by Ingres. With Apache HTTPd's mpm-winnt module this
is configured using ThreadsPerChild and with the worker module this is
controlled using the MaxSpareThreads (with Apache HTTPd worker MaxSpareThreads
controls the overall number threads across all child processes). Verify that
the number of threads in the HTTP server does not exceed the number of GCC
sessions or DBMS server sessions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support

Support for the PECL Ingres interface is available from a number of different
sources. Users with a support contract can either raise an issue via https://
servicedesk.ingres.com/ or through their local technical support department.
See http://ingres.com/support for a complete list of locations, primary service
hours, and telephone numbers. Users without a support contract can post
questions or problems to the Ingres Community Forums (http://
community.ingres.com/forum/php), to comp.databases.ingres (http://
groups.google.com/group/comp.databases.ingres), or to the PECL developer
mailing list (http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future direction

New features planned for the Ingres PECL extension are documented in the TODO
file that is shipped with the source code or via PHP's_CVS_source_code
repository.

Comments/suggestions/credits

The architecture for the Ingres extension is based on code written by David
Hénot (henot@php.net) from 2000-2004. Since February 2005, Grant Croker,
(grantc@php.net), took over the maintenance and development of the extension.
If you have any comments, features or if you wish to assist in some way with
coding, testing or documentation please contact grantc@php.net.
